# travel_places

This is my internship project.


With the help of firebase dependencies users can sign up and login to the app.
Users are saved to the firestore database.
Users can post a post (post contains title, picture and a description).
Users can make comments to posts.
Users can like posts.
Users can see their stats such as number of posts, likes, comments on the profile screen with their posts and profile image.
There is a role system in the app.
Admins can delete a user from the database.
Deleted users will get a email says 'they are banned from the app'.
